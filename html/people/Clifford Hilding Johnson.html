<p>
Born: 15 or 16 May 1909.
</p>

<p>
In the 1910 federal census it can be found that the baby Clifford lived on Racine (unclear street name) in Chicago Ward 25, Cook county, with his parents, Svea Josefina and Nils. <a href="../media/america/31111_4328163-00719_w.html">image</a>.
</p>

<p>
Clifford Hilding baptised on 16 April 1914 in the Trinity Lutheran Church in Chicago. The sponsors were three siblings of his mother Svea: Karl Johan, Nils Birger and Ida Maria Larsson. It can be noted that the family now live on Osgood street. <a href="../media/america/47830_554937-00075_w.html">image</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the 1920 federal census it can be found that the family, with the addition of the a baby brother Stanley, still is living on Osgood street. Further, Svea Josefinas brother, Nils Birger is for the moment living with the family.  <a href="../media/america/4300485_00377_w.html">image</a>.
</p>

<p>
Clifford Hilding was confirmed on 24 April 1923 in the Ebenezer Lutheran Church in Chicago. <a href="../media/america/48258_554965-00519_w.html">image</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the 1930 federal census the family has moved to Claremont street 6037, which is a house they have bought. Both Clifford, who is working as a draftsman, and Stanley still live at home.

<p>
In 1940 Clifford was drafted for the second world war. The registration card states that he lives on 1609 Rascher, Cook county, Chicago, with his wife Grace Eunice Johnson. It is also said that he is employed by the Maerican Mutual Liability Insurance Company. <a href="../media/america/44008_01_00099-01667_w.html">image</a>
</p>

<p>
An obituary in the Chicago Tribune on 30 November 1949, with correct details about parents and brother, states that he had a wife named Grace (neé Widmark) and three children, Clifford, Thomas and Janis. This information aligns with a picture found in Kragared, which is of of three people named Clifford, Thomas and Janis. <a href="../media/obituary/chj1909_w.html">obituary</a>.

<p>
It is my suspicion that Grace Eunice Johnson is the Grace Widmark who is the daughter of Axel and Ida Widmark. She is almost the same age as Clifforg Hilding and is living in nearby ward. [Download from census and add images here] image
