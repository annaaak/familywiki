<p>
Born: 16 June 1916 as the second son to Nils and Svea Josefina and baby brother to Clifford Hilding.  
</p>

<p>
Stanley Nils was baptised on 22 july 1917 in the Trinity Lutheran Church in Chicago. The sponsor were the brother of his mother Svea: Nils Birger. It can be noted that the family now live on Osgood street. <a href="../media/america/47830_554937-00364_w.html">image</a>.

<p>
In the 1920 federal census it can be found that the family, still is living on Osgood street. Further, Svea Josefinas brother, Nils Birger is for the moment living with the family.  <a href="../media/america/4300485_00377_w.html">image</a>.

<p>
In the 1930 federal census the family has moved to Claremont street 6037, which is a house they have bought. Both Clifford, who is working as a draftsman, and Stanley still live at home.

<p>
I have not found any church books to confirm, but an obituary in the Chicago Tribune on 30 November 1949, with details about parents and brother that are correct, states that he also had a wife named Grace (ne√© Widmark) and three children, Clifford, Thomas and Janis. <a href="../media/obituary/chj1909_w.html">obituary</a>.
