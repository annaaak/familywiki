In 1940 Clifford Hilding Johnson was drafted for the second world war. The registration card states that he lives on 1609 Rascher, Cook county, Chicago, with his wife Grace Eunice Johnson. <a href="../media/america/44008_01_00099-01667_w.html">image</a>
</p>

<p>
An obituary in the Chicago Tribune on 30 November 1949, with correct details about parents and brother, states that Clifford Hilding had a wife named Grace (ne√© Widmark) and three children, Clifford, Thomas and Janis. This information aligns with a picture found in Kragared, which is of of three people named Clifford, Thomas and Janis. <a href="../media/obituary/chj1909_w.html">obituary</a>.

It is my suspicion that Grace Eunice is the Grace Widmark who is the daughter of Axel and Ida Widmark. She is almost the same age as Clifforg Hilding and is living in nearby ward. <a href="../media/america/4300487_w.html">image</a>. This still needs to be verified, though.

Grace remarried May 24 1951 to Russell Carl Hagen. Source: Cook County Genealogy Records, marriage license {434EFBB2-4D91-4256-B120-EB8041E340FE}, file number 2183128.
